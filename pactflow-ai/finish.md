What are test templates?

> Test Templates allow teams to generate contract tests that align with their existing style, frameworks, and SDK versions. By defining templates as code or providing additional contextual prompts, users can ensure that generated tests match their project conventions from the start, reducing manual refactoring and improving efficiency.

Test Templates are supported for all forms of test generation.
