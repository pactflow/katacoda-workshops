In the scenario, you will create your first contract, publish it to Pactflow, verify it on your provider.

The course is written in Java, however, extensive experience with the language will not be required for the workshop.

## Workshop Prerequisites

* Have a Pactflow account (https://pactflow.io) and access to a [read/write API Token](https://docs.pactflow.io/#configuring-your-api-token)

## Goals

Ultimately, our goal is to get you up and integrated with Pactflow as quickly as possible!

You will:

1. Learn the basic concepts of Pact.
1. Get hands-on experience with the key aspects of writing, publishing and verifying pacts.
1. See how Pactflow fits into the picture so that you can get up and running quickly.

## Project Structure

Note that there will be two projects as we progress through the workshop, you can find them in the following directories:

* Consumer project: `/root/pactflow-example-consumer-java-junit`
* Provider project: `/root/pactflow-example-provider-springboot`

The workshop will guide you through both of these.
