## Congratulations!

You've completed the SmartBear MCP Server with OpenCode workshop! 🎉

## What You've Learned

Throughout this workshop, you've learned how to:

✅ Install and configure the SmartBear MCP Server
✅ Set up authentication with SmartBear services (PactFlow, SwaggerHub)
✅ Connect OpenCode to the MCP server
✅ Use MCP tools to interact with PactFlow and SwaggerHub
✅ Generate code from contracts and API specifications
✅ Automate deployment safety checks
✅ Create contract-driven development workflows

## Key Takeaways

1. **MCP as a Bridge**: The Model Context Protocol provides a standardized way for AI assistants to interact with external tools and services
2. **Enhanced Productivity**: By connecting OpenCode to SmartBear services, you can automate many routine development tasks
3. **Contract-Driven Development**: Use contracts as the source of truth for generating clients, servers, and tests
4. **Deployment Safety**: Automate deployment decisions based on contract verification status
5. **Consistency**: AI-generated code follows best practices and maintains consistency across your codebase

## Best Practices Recap

- 🔐 **Security**: Always use environment variables for credentials
- 🔄 **Updates**: Keep the MCP server package up to date
- ✅ **Validation**: Review AI-generated code before merging
- 📚 **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of your MCP setup
- 🧪 **Testing**: Always test generated code thoroughly
