- VS Code or compatible editor
- Some experience with command-line tools
- Basic understanding of API testing concepts

## Goals

Learn how to set up and use the [SmartBear MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server](https://github.com/SmartBear/smartbear-mcp-server) with OpenCode for AI-augmented development workflows.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI applications to securely integrate with local and remote resources. MCP provides a universal, open standard for connecting AI assistants to the systems where data lives, including content repositories, business tools, and development environments.

## What is SmartBear MCP Server?

The SmartBear MCP Server provides AI assistants with access to SmartBear tools and platforms, including:
- PactFlow (contract testing)
- SwaggerHub (API design and documentation)
- Test execution and analysis capabilities

## What is OpenCode?

OpenCode is an AI-powered coding assistant that supports MCP servers, allowing you to leverage SmartBear's testing and API capabilities directly within your development workflow.
