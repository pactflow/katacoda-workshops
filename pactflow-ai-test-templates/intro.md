## Workshop Prerequisites - Online

- If this is your first introduction to PactFlow AI, we would recommend the PactFlow AI Starter course.
- All of the Prerequisites shown in the below section are already added to your online environment.

## Workshop Prerequisites - Locally

<!--- Java 11 --->
- NodeJS 16+ (20 is used in this demo)
- Git
- Docker
- Some experience with command-line tools.

## Goals

Leverage [PactFlow's Test Generation capabilities](https://docs.pactflow.io/docs/ai) with user provided Test Templates.

## Using Test Templates

Test Templates allow teams to generate contract tests that align with their existing style, frameworks, and SDK versions. By defining templates as code or providing additional contextual prompts, users can ensure that generated tests match their project conventions from the start, reducing manual refactoring and improving efficiency.

Test Templates are supported for all forms of test generation.

## Scenarios

1. Setup
   1. Download the `pactflow-ai` cli tool
   2. Setup authentication to your PactFlow account
2. Grab a sample OpenAPI file
3. Create a test template
4. Generate a contract test
5. Pass in additional prompts to PactFlow AI to customize the output

## Ready to start?

See the terminal on the right-hand side? It's currently installing NodeJS and some additional tools which are used in this demo.

Please wait until it's finished and you get a message saying good to go!

Thanks and enjoy.
