# Testing the provider

Now that we have our working Provider, we need to do two things to prevent introducing breaking changes to our consumers.

1. Ensure the API doesn't drift from it's OpenAPI description document (OAS)
2. Ensure the OAS doesn't change such that it could break any of its consumers

Right now, we don't have any consumers, but we want to be prepared for when we do.

### Verifying the provider contract (1)

There are severals ways we can test the Provider, to ensure it doesn't drift from the OAS. This process is referred to as _verifying the provider contract_.

1. Generate the OAS from code. This is the most reliable, because whenever the implementation changes, the OAS will change with it. Tools like Spring Docs (Java) and Swashbuckle (.NET) will do this for you.
1. White-box style tests that run as part of your unit tests. Tools such as RestAssured (Java) or Supertest (NodeJS) are examples of
1. Black-box style functional API testing, using tools like Dredd or Postman.

In our case, (1) is not acceptable as we've chosen to following design first approach. We decided to use (3), using a tool called Dredd. Dredd will read in our OAS, and issue HTTP calls to our locally running provider to ensure it's compatible with the spec.

#### Run the Provider tests

When using a black-box style tool, the testing involves the following steps:

1. Starting the API locally, stubbing out downstream dependencies where possible
1. Preparing data so that all of the OAS scenarios may be tested
1. Configuring the tool to read in the OAS and discover the provider
1. Running the tool
1. Capturing the output

Here is the Dredd configuration file, with some properties removed for clarity:

`example-provider-dredd/dredd.yml`{{open}}

<pre class="file" >
...
language: nodejs
server: npm start
server-wait: 3
reporter: [markdown]
output: [./output/report.md]
loglevel: warning
config: ./dredd.yml
blueprint: ./oas/products.yml
endpoint: 'http://127.0.0.1:3000'
</pre>

## Check

Now we can run the tests:

1. `cd /root/example-provider-dredd`{{execute interrupt}}
1. `npm t`{{execute interrupt}}

Your ouput should look like this:

```
$ npm t

> product-service@1.0.0 test /root/example-provider-dredd
> dredd


> product-service@1.0.0 start /root/example-provider-dredd
> node server.js

Provider API listening on port 3000...

pass: GET (200) /product/10 duration: 24ms
complete: 3 passing, 0 failing, 0 errors, 0 skipped, 3 total

```

As you can see, Dredd has issued calls to all 3 endpoints and the tests are âœ….

<!-- ## Deploy

Now we've created our provider and confirmed it can meet the needs of its consumers, we can deploy it to production!

As with the consumer, we can first check if this is safe to do: `npm run can-deploy:provider`{{execute}}

Great! Because the Provider meets the needs of the consumer (and the consumer is not yet in production) it is safe to do.

Deploy the provider: `npm run deploy:provider`{{execute}}

_REMINDER: The `can-i-deploy` command is an important part of a CI/CD workflow, adding stage gates to prevent deploying incompatible applications to environments such as production_

This diagram shows an illustrative CI/CD pipeline as it relates to our progress to date:

## Check

Your dashboard should look something like this, where your provider has been tagged as having been deployed to `prod`:
